# Codes_outreach
An outreach activity centred around codes. An set of activities that combine Maths, Computing

1. Substitution codes - where letters are shifted n times or randomly swapped around. Can you guess a weakness of this approach that can be used to crack them? Why not create your own coded message and leave it on a whiteboard for others to try and crack? Can you crack other peoples messages on the whiteboard? 
Also, anothe common type of code is a Book Cipher - In the Sherlock series, Holmes discovers that a popular book is being used as a code by Chinese gangsters https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/91fe0e1e-9f00-42ec-ac00-8f614ba9ef09
e.g. 6/11 means page 6 word 11 (but you need to know what book is being used!).
Materials: Scrap paper, pens/pencils. Whiteboard/flipchart paper & markerpens.

2. Morse code - an early way to communicate over wires or by radio. Letters are encoded by patterns of short (dot) and long (dash) beeps. Examine the morse code charts - why do we not start with A = ., B= -, c = .. ?
Try sending a (short) message in Morse code using our Morse key buzzer?
Materials: Morse diagrams, morse key (Button switches, battery, buzzer/led& resistor)

3. ASCII and binary representation of data. When you use a computer, the letters and numbers are frequently stored using the ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange). Each character is represented by a code e.g. A is 65. These are converted and stored as a binary representation of that number and trasnmitted as a series of oneas and zeroes (often represented as two different tones.
