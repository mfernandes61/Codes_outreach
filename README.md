# Codes_outreach
An outreach activity centred around codes. An set of activities that combine Maths, Computing and Biology

1. Substitution codes - where letters are shifted n times or randomly swapped around. Can you guess a weakness of this approach that can be used to crack them? Why not create your own coded message and leave it on a whiteboard for others to try and crack? Can you crack other peoples messages on the whiteboard?   
Also, anothe common type of code is a Book Cipher - In the Sherlock series, Holmes discovers that a popular book is being used as a code by Chinese gangsters https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/91fe0e1e-9f00-42ec-ac00-8f614ba9ef09
e.g. 6/11 means page 6 word 11 (but you need to know what book is being used!).    
Materials: Scrap paper, pens/pencils. Whiteboard/flipchart paper & markerpens.

2. Morse code - an early way to communicate over wires or by radio. Letters are encoded by patterns of short (dot) and long (dash) beeps. Examine the morse code charts - why do we not start with A = ., B= -, c = .. ?    
Try sending a (short) message in Morse code using our Morse key buzzer?    
Materials: Morse diagrams, morse key (Button switches, battery, buzzer/led& resistor).   

3. ASCII and binary representation of data. When you use a computer, the letters and numbers are frequently stored using the ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) code. Each character is represented by a code e.g. A is 65. These are converted and stored as a binary representation of that number and trasnmitted as a series of ones and zeroes (often represented as two different tones.   
Resiliency in communication - concept of parity bits.    
Challenge: Try writing your first name as binary, decimal or hexadecimal code.    
Materials: Video/audio of tones, ASCII chart, card name badges (for code names)?.    

4. DNA - bological code
The bases - triplets - resilience via redundancy in code of genes.   
Genes code for protein - lots of roles iincluding gene regulation.   
Amino acid code - Challenge: Write your name as codons 
Protein - form = function. Structure often related to functionality. 2ndary structure could be changed 
if wrong amino acid is read from code. If mistake selects another AA with similar properties e.g. hydrophobicity 
then maystill be partially or wholly functional.     
Mutations where wrong reading of code e.g. DNA damaged & failed/flwed repair leads to diseases including Cancer.
Materials: Pens/paper/badges, codon table
